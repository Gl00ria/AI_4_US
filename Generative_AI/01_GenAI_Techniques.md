#### 1. Large Language Models (LLMs):

This is the foundational technology behind **ChatGPT**, as mentioned in [04_Neural_Network_Architecture](https://github.com/Gl00ria/AI_4_US/blob/main/00_Warm_Up/04_Neural_Network_Architecture.md), its trained on vast volume of text to predict word relationships.

#### 2. Diffusion Models:

Advanced AI tools used for generating images and videos. [Dall-e 3](https://openai.com/index/dall-e-3/) is an example.

---

#### 3. Generative Adversarial Networks a.k.a **Gens**:

Commonly used for generating text and images.

**How it works?** it works on 2 algorithms, **Generator algorithm** to generate content, and the other is **Judge algorithm** to judge its realism. Both algorithms work together to enhance their capability and refine the content until it's indistinguishable from reality.

#### 4. Neural Radiance Fields:

Specialized AI in **3D** modeling.

---

#### 5. Hybrid Models:

A hybrid approach combines **LLMs** & **Gens**.
