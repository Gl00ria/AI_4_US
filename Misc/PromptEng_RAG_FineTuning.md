All three techniques enhance the **LLM's** response accuracy & effectiveness by targeting specific aspects of the AI's functionality.
| | **Prompt Engineering** | **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** | **Fine-tuning** |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **How?**| Tell the **Model** how to behave | Expand context by attaching a library | Additional training for already trained model |
| **Weight status** | doesn't change | doesn't change | does change |
| **Technique** | Verbal instructions | Attach a Database | Extra data |
| **Model status** | doesn't change | doesn't change | does change |

In short, **Prompt Engineering** is interact with the model, and **RAG** to enhance the model, while **Fine Tuning** to change the model.
