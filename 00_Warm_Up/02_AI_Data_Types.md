## By Structure:

#### 1. Structured Data:

- Data organized into **Tables**, **Rows**, **Columns**.
- Easy to analyze with traditional **ML Algorithms**.
- Example: Databases, Spreadsheets.

#### 2. Unstructured Data:

- No defined structure and cannot be organized into **Rows** and **Columns**.
- Represents 80-90% of real world data.
- Requires Advanced techniques like deep learning, [CNNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) for images, [NLP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) for text.
- Example: text, images, videos, audio.

## By Annotation:

#### 1. Labeled Data:

- Contains target labels for supervised learning.
- Critical for training models to predict outcome.

#### 2. Unlabeled Data:

- No annotations or target output.
- Used for unsupervised/semi-supervised learning.

## Importance of Data Quality:

Data is being collected through various methods such as web scraping, APIs, and big data analytics. Thus, the data quality being collected does impact the model's effectiveness, so collecting high-quality data is necessary to produce reliable AI outputs.

## Clearing the confusion above:

- Structured Data != Labeled Data & Unstructured Data != Unlabeled Data.
- **Labeled Data** is more valued due the ease of analysis, but costly (requires manual annotation).
- Unstructured & Unlabeled are the most abundant but the hardest to leverage without labels.

## Challenges of Managing Data:

The rapid expansion of online platforms, [IoT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things), social media, sensors, etc... has resulted in a massive increase in data generation. Not only the Quantity, but also the Quality of the data has improved.

A large portion of this data is **Unstructured Data** and too vast to manually label or organize. In this case comes the **Metadata**.

**Metadata** is data about data, providing a key details such as asset type, author, creating date, usage, file size, and more.

## Which one To choose?

It depends on:

- Specific requirements of the project.
- Available resources.
- Model Performance.
