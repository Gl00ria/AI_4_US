#### Model Design:

1. Select an architecture depending on intended application. See [Neural Network Architecture](https://github.com/Gl00ria/AI_4_US/blob/main/00_Warm_Up/04_Neural_Network_Architecture.md)
2. Decide the Depth & Number of parameters it will contain, as this is important to define the Model's capabilities and limitations.
