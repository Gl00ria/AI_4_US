#### Model Design:

1. Select an architecture depending on the intended application. See [Neural Network Architecture](https://github.com/Gl00ria/AI_4_US/blob/main/00_Warm_Up/04_Neural_Network_Architecture.md)
2. Decide the Depth & Number of parameters it will contain, as this is important to define the Model's capabilities and limitations.
3. Collect data from publicly available sources or propriety datasets. Keep in mind, that the amount & quality of the data will influence the model's performance.
4. Cleanse and Structure the data to ensure that the model will train on high-quality information.

---

#### Pre-training:

- Address the key issues such as the data diversity biases within the training data.
- Early assessment of the model to understand its strength and the areas that needs improvement.

---

#### Post-training:

- Enhance the model's performance by using high-quality/targeted data **'Supervised Fine-tuning'**.
- Refine the model further through human feedback and annotations to improve its accuracy.

---

#### Final Testing & Evaluation:

- Optimize the model's wight for specific tasks improving speed & efficiency
- Comprehensive Review for:
  - Response quality.
  - Response accuracy.
  - Ethical Behavior.

#### What is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)?

Enhancing the model's response by integrating an external **database** for the model to query in order to pull additional context or information.

**Why?** to provide richer context for model response, useful for providing detailed knowledge.
