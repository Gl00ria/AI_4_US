#### 1. Supervised Learning:

In this type, the model's trained with known outputs guiding its learning process, it uses labeled data to teach models how to predict outputs based on input data

Example: identifying an image if it contains a dog or not, using a dataset where each image labeled 'dog' or 'not dog'.

#### 2. Unsupervised Learning:

In this type, the model's discovers relationships and patterns without direct input on the desired output, it analyzes data without pre-labeled data.

Example: differentiating between dogs & cat images without prior labels.

---

#### 3. Reinforcement Learning:

In this type, you teach the model to make decisions be rewarding the desired output and penalizing the undesired once. Here you optimize the model for a specific goal without labeled data. Also, it learns from direct interaction with the environment.

Example: A move site improving its recommendations based on the user feedback such as views, skips & rating.

#### 4. Deep Learning:

A subset of **ML** inspired by the Human's brain structure & function, this methodology allows the **AI** to process information in stages.
